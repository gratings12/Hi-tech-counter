# Hi-Tech Calculator

The Hi-Tech Calculator project is a web-based number manipulator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on a base number. Users can also increase or decrease a multiplier to influence how numbers are added or subtracted. The interface is simple and interactive, allowing users to enter values and see results in real time.
## Features



- Add: Adds the current multiplier value to the base number.

- Subtract: Subtracts the current multiplier value from the base number.

- Multiply: Multiplies the base number by a user-provided value.

- Divide: Divides the base number by a user-provided value.

- Increase Multiplier: Increases the multiplier by 1, which adjusts the amount added or subtracted.

- Decrease Multiplier: Decreases the multiplier by 1, reversing the operation for addition and subtraction.

- Reset: Resets the base number to 0 and the multiplier to 1.
## How to use it

- Multiplier: The initial multiplier is 1, and all operations are influenced by this value. Increasing or decreasing the multiplier changes how the number is manipulated.

- Base Number: The base number starts at 0 and is displayed in large font. Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division update this value.

- User Input: For division and multiplication, users are prompted to enter a number to perform the operation on the base number.
## Example Usage

- Add: Adds the current multiplier (e.g., 1) to the base number (0 becomes 1).

- Subtract: Subtracts the current multiplier from the base number (e.g., 1 becomes 0).

- Multiply: When prompted, input a value to multiply the base number (e.g., base 2 Ã— input 3 â†’ base becomes 6).

- Divide: When prompted, input a value to divide the base number (e.g., base 6 Ã· input 2 â†’ base becomes 3).

- Increase/Decrease Multiplier: Changes the multiplier used in addition and subtraction (e.g., increasing to 2 will double the effect of add and subtract operations).
